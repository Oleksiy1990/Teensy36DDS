This is a project to get a commercial DDS (direct digital synthesizer for radiofrequency pulses) controlled from an Arduino, and then integrated into a Python-based lab control system for an experimental atomic physics project. 

The project worked and delivered the technical centerpiece for the research that led to the publication [*Bloch oscillations with a metastable helium Bose-Einstein condensate*](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.061302)
